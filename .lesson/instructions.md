# Instructions  

This assignment will help you get acquainted with your Java development software. The Java program you will enter can be found to the left as "Assignment1Example.jpg".

In the "Main.java" file on the left, type the source code exactly as it is shown. Be sure to place all the punctuation characters and be careful to match the case of the letters as they are shown. Your changes should be automatically saved, so no need to save the program. 

Use the "Run" button to compile the program. If you typed the contents of the file exactly as shown, you shouldn’t have any syntax errors. If you see error messages, compare your code to that shown. Correct any mistakes you have made, save the file, and run the compiler again. If you see no error messages, the file was successfully compiled.

You should see the message “Hello World!” displayed.

Click the "Submit" button to submit your assignment. Remember to upload your pseudocode as a Word doc in Moodle.
